File Transfer using Socket Programming (TCP and UDP)
The idea is to provide a basic understanding of socket programming in python and analyzing the throughput achieved by differnet types of implementations. I have implemented variants of file transfer in terms of concurrency and algorithms. These variants are listed as follows:

Based on type of connection:
TCP
UDP
Based on Algorithms:
Nagle's Algorithm
Delayed ACK
Based on Concurrency:
concurrent server using Fork
concurrent server using threads
Based on Consistency:
Persistent TCP connection
Non-persistent TCP connection

TCP usage
Analyzing the algorithms

move into the folder tcp_algorithms
run server using python3 server.py and enter the port number
run client in another terminal using python3 client.py
enter the port number of the server
follow the instructions to enable or disable the algorithms
user can ask for only one file at a time
Concurrency - fork

move into the folder tcp_fork
run the server using python3 fork_server.py
run client in another terminal using python3 fork_client.py
ask the files in spave separated fashion like sherlock.txt warpeace.txt
the client side will connect with the server individually for each file (running the all the clients simultaneously)
Concurrency - threads

move into the folder tcp_thread
run the server using python3 thread_server.py
run client in another terminal using python3 thread_client.py
ask the files in spave separated fashion like sherlock.txt warpeace.txt
the client side will connect with the server individually for each file (running the all the clients simultaneously)
Non persistent TCP

move into the folder tcp_non_persistent
run the server using python3 nonp_server.py
run client in another terminal using python3 nonp_client.py
ask the files in spave separated fashion like sherlock.txt warpeace.txt
one by one file transfer (each creating a new tcp connection)
UDP usage
In UDP, persistent and non-persistent remains same because there is no particular handshake in UDP which initiates the connection.
